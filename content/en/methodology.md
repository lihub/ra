How Quantica Works

## header_subtitle
Understanding the science behind intelligent portfolio optimization

## mathematical_foundation_title
Mathematical Foundation

## mathematical_foundation_description
Quantica is built on Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), the Nobel Prize-winning framework developed by Harry Markowitz. Our platform combines decades of academic research with cutting-edge computational methods to create optimal portfolios for every risk tolerance.

## efficient_frontier_title
üéØ Efficient Frontier

## efficient_frontier_description
We calculate the mathematically optimal risk-return combinations across all possible portfolio allocations, ensuring you achieve maximum expected return for your chosen risk level.

## covariance_optimization_title
üìä Covariance Optimization

## covariance_optimization_description
Advanced correlation analysis between assets reduces portfolio volatility through intelligent diversification, lowering overall risk without sacrificing returns.

## risk_return_balance_title
‚öñÔ∏è Risk-Return Balance

## risk_return_balance_description
Sharpe ratio optimization maximizes risk-adjusted returns, ensuring every unit of risk taken contributes meaningfully to portfolio performance.
