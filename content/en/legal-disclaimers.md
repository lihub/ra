Investment Disclaimer

## investment_disclaimer_content
Quantica provides algorithmic portfolio recommendations based on Modern Portfolio Theory and historical market data. All investments involve risk of loss, and past performance does not guarantee future results. The value of investments may fluctuate, and you may receive back less than your original investment.

Quantica is not a registered investment advisor and does not provide personalized investment advice. Our recommendations are based solely on mathematical optimization algorithms and should not be considered as personal financial advice. You should consult with qualified financial professionals before making investment decisions.
